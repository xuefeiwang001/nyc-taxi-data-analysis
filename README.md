# NYC Taxi Data Analysis – End-to-End Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of New York City taxi trip data,
designed to demonstrate how raw operational data can be transformed into
business-relevant insights and actionable recommendations.

Rather than focusing solely on modeling techniques, the project emphasizes:
- structured analytical thinking,
- interpretability of results,
- and clear communication with non-technical stakeholders.

📄 **Final Deliverable:**  
- **Key Insights & Business Recommendations**

## 🎯 Business Questions
The analysis is guided by practical, decision-oriented questions:

- What are the main drivers of taxi fares?
- Are there statistically significant differences between trip types?
- How well can we predict key outcomes using historical data?
- What operational or analytical improvements can be recommended based on the findings?

## 🧠 Analytical Workflow
The project follows a realistic analytics workflow commonly used in industry:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning**
   - Understanding data structure and distributions
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Preparing analysis-ready datasets

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Hypothesis testing and group comparisons
   - Distribution analysis and statistical significance

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Regression modeling for interpretable baseline predictions
   - Machine learning models for improved performance
   - Model evaluation with business-oriented metrics

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Synthesis of results across analyses
   - Translation of technical findings into business recommendations
   - Discussion of limitations and next steps
